# Coursera Developing Data Products Course Project
This repository contains code for the final project for the course Developing Data Products on Coursera.

The code creates a shinny app called Interest_Calculator which allows to calculate simple or compound interest. The app is available [here] ( https://sjojoa.shinyapps.io/Interest_Calculator).

There is also a short presentation about the app [here] (sebasj23.github.io/Coursera-DevDataProd-Presentation/index.html). The repository with the code that generated this presentation is [here] (https://github.com/SebasJ23/Coursera-DevDataProd-Presentation).
